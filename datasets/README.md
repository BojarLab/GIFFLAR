# Datasets in GIFFLAR

This directory contains the datasets used in the GIFFLAR project. There are two types of datasets: single-label and 
multi-label classification datasets. The single-label datasets store the number of the class as label and have an 
additional file that maps the class number to the class name. The multi-label datasets have one column per class and 
the value of the column is 1 if the class is present in the sample and 0 otherwise.
